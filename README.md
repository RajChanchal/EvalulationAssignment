# EvalulationAssignment

- I have implemented both Storyboard and non-storyboard versions of the same list view. Storyboard one runs by default, if you want to see the programmatically done version, uncomment the code in AppDelegte's method: ```application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool```

- One test case is also written to verify the currency formation
- Assignment #1 answers are written in file named: ```iOS Assignment 1.docx```
- Assignemtn #2's notes are written in file named: ```iOS Assignment 2 Notes.docx```
- Both word files are in the root directory of the project.
